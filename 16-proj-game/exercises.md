# Chapter 16 - Project: A Platform Game

## 1. Game Over

It’s traditional for platform games to have the player start with a limited number of lives and subtract one life each time they die. When the player is out of lives, the game restarts from the beginning.

Adjust `runGame` to implement lives. Have the player start with three. Output the current number of lives (using `console.log`) every time a level starts.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/game.css">

<body>
<script>
  // The old runGame function. Modify it...
  async function runGame(plans, Display) {
    for (let level = 0; level < plans.length;) {
      let status = await runLevel(new Level(plans[level]),
                                  Display);
      if (status == "won") level++;
    }
    console.log("You've won!");
  }
  runGame(GAME_LEVELS, DOMDisplay);
</script>
</body>
```

## 2. Pausing the Game

Make it possible to pause (suspend) and unpause the game by pressing esc. You can do this by changing the `runLevel` function to set up a keyboard event handler that interrupts or resumes the animation whenever esc is hit.

The `runAnimation` interface may not look like it is suitable for this at first glance, but it is if you rearrange the way `runLevel` calls it.

When you have that working, there’s something else you can try. The way we’ve been registering keyboard event handlers is somewhat problematic. The `arrowKeys` object is currently a global binding, and its event handlers are kept around even when no game is running. You could say they leak out of our system. Extend `trackKeys` to provide a way to unregister its handlers, then change `runLevel` to register its handlers when it starts and unregister them again when it is finished.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/game.css">

<body>
<script>
  // The old runLevel function. Modify this...
  function runLevel(level, Display) {
    let display = new Display(document.body, level);
    let state = State.start(level);
    let ending = 1;
    return new Promise(resolve => {
      runAnimation(time => {
        state = state.update(time, arrowKeys);
        display.syncState(state);
        if (state.status == "playing") {
          return true;
        } else if (ending > 0) {
          ending -= time;
          return true;
        } else {
          display.clear();
          resolve(state.status);
          return false;
        }
      });
    });
  }
  runGame(GAME_LEVELS, DOMDisplay);
</script>
</body>
```

## 3. A Monster

It is traditional for platform games to have enemies that you can defeat by jumping on top of them. This exercise asks you to add such an actor type to the game.

We’ll call this actor a monster. Monsters move only horizontally. You can make them move in the direction of the player, bounce back and forth like horizontal lava, or have any other movement pattern you want. The class doesn’t have to handle falling, but it should make sure the monster doesn’t walk through walls.

When a monster touches the player, the effect depends on whether the player is jumping on top of them or not. You can approximate this by checking whether the player’s bottom is near the monster’s top. If this is the case, the monster disappears. If not, the game is lost.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/game.css">
<style>.monster { background: purple }</style>

<body>
  <script>
    // Complete the constructor, update, and collide methods
    class Monster {
      constructor(pos, /* ... */) {}

      get type() { return "monster"; }

      static create(pos) {
        return new Monster(pos.plus(new Vec(0, -1)));
      }

      update(time, state) {}

      collide(state) {}
    }

    Monster.prototype.size = new Vec(1.2, 2);

    levelChars["M"] = Monster;

    runLevel(new Level(`
